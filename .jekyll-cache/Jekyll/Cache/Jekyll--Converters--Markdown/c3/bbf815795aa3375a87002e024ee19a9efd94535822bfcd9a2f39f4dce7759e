  <p>‘Oh Maud, why don’t you marry me and give up this tragic struggle and live a peaceful life? I could make such a beautiful life for you among artists and writers who would understand you.’</p>

  <p>　</p>

  <p>‘Willie, are you not tired of asking that question? How often have I told you to thank the gods that I will not marry you. You would not be happy with me.’</p>

  <p>　</p>

  <p>‘I am not happy without you.’</p>

  <p>　</p>

  <p>‘Oh yes, you are, because you make beautiful poetry out of what you call your unhappiness and you are happy in that. Marriage would be such a dull affair. Poets should never marry. The world should thank me for not marrying you.’</p>
